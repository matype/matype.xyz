Hi, I'm Masaki Morishita, a type designer who loves open-source and decentralized things.

Now, I delve into personal projects like typeface design and font engineering, diving deep into the details. I make everything I create open source, so feel free to check out my [GitHub](https://github.com/matype) if you're interested.
