Hi, my name is Masaaki Morishita, and I'm passionate about creating cool things with computers. You can call me a designer or an engineer â€” either title fits.

Now, I delve into personal projects like typeface design and font engineering, diving deep into the details. I make everything I create open source, so feel free to check out my [GitHub](https://github.com/matype) if you're interested.
